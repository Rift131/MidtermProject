## Lessons Learned

Trello- Keep highest level on the User Story and write out sub cards that get you to the User Story completion.

* MileStone 3 LL: Troubleshooting became second nature to recognize problems with our database values versus our mappings of the entities with each other. As we progressed with establishing relationships between the tables,  we learned to adjust initial variables to the corresponding data type being linked with the table. If we omitted this change, the JUnit tests would result in an immediate termination and no test results. We quickly learned the error most likely was due to omitting a change of the variable to the object being linked. After pair programming for several hours, writing code and troubleshooting became more and more challenging. They key to pressing forward through blockers was to find different ways to view the problem, either through the ERDiagram or previous code that tackled the same problem. Changing perspective is key.
